-- This script is incompatible with the current database schema
-- It tries to create triggers for Supabase Auth's auth.users table
-- The database uses a simple "users" table with integer IDs, not Supabase Auth
-- This script should not be run - it's kept for reference only

-- The current authentication system doesn't use Supabase Auth triggers
