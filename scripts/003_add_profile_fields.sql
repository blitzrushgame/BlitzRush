-- This script is incompatible with the current database schema
-- It tries to modify a "profiles" table which doesn't exist
-- The database uses a simple "users" table with integer IDs, not Supabase Auth
-- This script should not be run - it's kept for reference only

-- If you need to add avatar_url or bio fields, add them to the "users" table instead
